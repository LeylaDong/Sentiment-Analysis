# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is one of the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allow technical approaches to analyzing human opinion in the form of text. It is a method that allows the computer to understand the underlying emotion and opinion in text form regarding a particular topic. 

The concept of this study is sentiment analysis in reviews of 38 movies performed by Robert Pattinson. The study uses data from Movies' comments on IMDB and reviews on Metacritic uploaded by viewers. Both datasets are divided into two categories, positive and negative emotion. The positive data means that the person is given a positive emotion towards the movie and potentially will recommend the movie to others. And the negative emotion means the opposite. 

This study conducted sentiment analysis using several machine learning techniques. The approaches implemented in our case are 

1.Logistic model

2.Random forest

3.Light GBM

4.Neural Network.
